# terraform fmt
 command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style

# terraform validate
 command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.

# terraform plan
 command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. By default, when Terraform creates a plan it:

# terraform apply
 command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan

# terraform destroy
 command is a convenient way to destroy all remote objects managed by a particular Terraform configuration.
